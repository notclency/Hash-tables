# Hash-tables

Learning and playing around with hash-tables

!!!  This is not a redo of Assignmen 3 part 2 or Part 1 - this is similiar to the Assignment becuase of the data used  !!!

- Writing a program that collects data from a file and stores them in a hash-table.
  This programs reads data from a file in the format "C f 9 6 0 Sarah Nurse"
  where 'C', 'f', '9', '6', '0' are the players data & "Sarah Nurse is the players name" stores them in a player class
  containing variables for the data to be stored then stores this class in HashNode. This HashNode contains a key, a player Node
  and a next HashNode (chaining).

- Collision are resolved by chaining.

- Feel free to test run & test the code.
- Certain test have been implemented in the main class.
