# Hash-tables
Learning and playing around with hash-tables

!!! Much of this at the moment is uncompleted and still in progress  !!!

Writing a program that collects data from a file and stores them in a hash-table.
I'll be dealing with collisions by chaining.
Code contains basic hash-tables functions like "search", "insert" and "delete".
